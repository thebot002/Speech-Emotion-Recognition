Description - The topic of this project is emotion recognition from speech signals. To achieve that, a model can be trained using an audio database containing a variety of emotions (either basic or compound) for different speakers, e.g., EMODB (German), EMOVO (Italian), IEMOCAP (English), etc. Low-level descriptors can be computed either manually or using a dedicated tool, such as openSMILE, which provides a complete set of features for each specific audio recognition. Also, feature embedding using simple/variational autoencoders can be used. Training can be achieved using neural networks, either shallow or deep. The final output should be a system able to identify emotions based either on a basic psychological model (basic emotions) or using a bi-dimensional representation (positive/negative valence and high/low activation).
